**Movie Recommendation live project**
A Movie Recommendation System is a popular Data Science project that utilizes machine learning algorithms to recommend movies to users based on their preferences. The core idea behind such a system is to predict what movies a user would like by analyzing their past movie-watching behavior or by comparing users with similar preferences. These systems are widely used by streaming platforms like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime to personalize the user experience
